- **Platform Engineering** - Designing resilient, scalable infrastructure solutions
- **Developer Tooling** - Creating tools that make complex systems simple

## Key Projects & Experience

### Agentkube (Founder / CEO - Dec 2024 - Present)
It’s an AI-powered IDE for Kubernetes that helps DevOps and Platform teams diagnose and resolve production issues up to 80% faster. Teams rely on 10–15 fragmented cloud-native tools across observability, cost monitoring, security, and CI/CD. During incidents, engineers lose critical time switching contexts, correlating logs, metrics, and traces, and escalating issues to a small number of senior operators.
- Agentkube consolidates debugging, cost visibility, and security insights into a single desktop IDE, with deep integrations across Kubernetes APIs, observability platforms such as New Relic, Datadog, and the LGTM stack, and cloud infrastructure. Using agent-driven root-cause analysis and Model Context Protocols (MCP), Agentkube surfaces actionable insights directly from cluster telemetry, enabling faster incident resolution, improved cost efficiency, and earlier detection of security risks.
